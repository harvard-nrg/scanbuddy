## Example docker-compose.yml file

# You can run a complete standalone system which serves an
# SMB share for the scanner to write to. Then, the entire 
# system is just a `docker compose up` away:

services:
  scanbuddy:
    image: scanbuddy:v0.1.9
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    depends_on:
      - samba
      - redis
    environment:
      # you might want passwords in a .env file
      SCANBUDDY_PASS: some_password
      SCANBUDDY_SESSION_KEY: some_password
    volumes:
      - /home/qc/scanbuddy:/scanbuddy
      - /home/qc/scanbuddy-data:/data
    command: ["-c", "/scanbuddy/config.yaml", "--folder", "/data", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -fsSL -u scanbuddy:$$SCANBUDDY_PASS http://localhost:8080 | grep -q DashRenderer"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli","ping"]

  samba:
    image: ghcr.io/servercontainers/samba
    restart: unless-stopped
    # you {c,sh}ould expose individual ports instead
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      SAMBA_CONF_LOG_LEVEL: 3
      WSDD2_DISABLE: 1
      AVAHI_DISABLE: 1
      NETBIOS_DISABLE: 1
      GROUP_fakegroup: 20
      ACCOUNT_scanbuddy: some_password
      UID_scanbuddy: 501
      GROUPS_scanbuddy: fakegroup
      SAMBA_VOLUME_CONFIG_scanbuddy: "[scanbuddy]; path=/data; valid users = scanbuddy; guest ok = no; read only = no; browseable = yes"
